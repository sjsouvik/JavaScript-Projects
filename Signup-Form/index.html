<!-- 
Building robust forms is one of core skills that a Front End developer should have. One of the most 
common forms people encounter everyday is a signup form.

Implement a signup form to allow users to fill in their details and submit the form.

Requirements:

The form should contain the following elements with the following criteria:

- Username field
    - Minimum of 4 characters.
    - Alphanumeric only.
- Email field
    - Valid email format. A reasonable validation will suffice, you don't have to strictly follow any specification.
- Password field
    - Minimum of 6 characters.
- Confirm password field
    - Must match the password field.
- Submit button
    - Contains the text "Sign Up".
    - Clicking on the submit button submits the form.

You are free to decide when (during typing/after blur/upon submission) and 
how (native HTML validation or custom validation) to validate the form. If the validation fails, 
show the relevant errors near (beside or below) the corresponding <input> fields.

Submission API:

A submitForm function has been implemented for you in index.js which makes an AJAX POST request to a 
server-side API which validates the fields using the same criteria. You can use it to verify that your
form is not allowing invalid input.

Learning:

Since the browser has native form validation capabilities, we will make use of it so that we can write 
less JavaScript.

HTML-based validation doesn't allow for customization of the error styling. Hence these days, it's 
no surprise that many forms opt for JavaScript-based validation to have more control over the 
validation styling. In interview settings, there are tight time constraints. If there is no 
requirement for specific validation styling, using HTML-based validation will save you some time 
and also demonstrate your HTML knowledge to the interviewer which is a positive signal.

This question is a good opportunity to get familiar with HTML-based validation if you aren't already. 
There's very little JavaScript we need to write if we use HTML-based validation. 
Only the matching password confirmation has to be done using JavaScript.

The following attributes on `<input>` are especially helpful for validating form values before 
submission can occur:

- `required`: input value must be non-empty.
- `pattern`: input value must match the specified regular expression.
- `minlength`: input value must contain the minimum number of characters.

There are more validation attributes(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) 
but the above are the ones relevant to signup forms.

All the fields are `required`, so we can add this attribute to all the <input>s.

- Username: To validate a minimum of 4 characters, use `minlength="4"`. 
To validate the alphanumeric constraint, we use a simple regex of `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$`.

- Email: By using `type="email"`, the browser will validate that the value matches an email format 
if it's non-empty.

- Password/Confirm password: Use `minlength="6"` for minimum length validation and type="password" to 
hide the values.

Since we also need to validate that the password matches, we can add a 'submit' event listener to the form, 
use `event.preventDefault()` to intercept the browser submit, and validate using JavaScript. 
If the password validation fails, we show the error message below the password confirmation field.

Accessibility:

- Link `<label>`s to `<input>` so that clicking on the <label> will focus on the corresponding <input>.
    - Use `<label for="some-id">` and `<input id="some-id">` to define the relation 
    between `<label>` and `<input>`.
    - You can nest `<input>`s inside of `<label>`s but note that some assistive technologies
    (e.g. Dragon NaturallySpeaking) do not support it.
- Apply a styling for `<input>` focus to clearly tell users which field they're on.
- Link the error message up with the password confirmation field by using `aria-describedby` 
to indicate that the error message is for that `<input>` field.
